## Why I built this

My objective was to build a small project that would help me practice, but I wanted to do something meaningful to me. Reading is one of my passions. I believe that stories can teach, entertain and inspire, that's why I built StoryTime. In the future, I would love to combine this with AI and have randomly generated stories that can be customised.
